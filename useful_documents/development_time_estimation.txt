## TOTAL PROJECT EFFORT

- Work completed: 120-160 hours
- Remaining work: 100-120 hours
- Total project estimation: 220-280 hours

## NOTES

The remaining work involves significant development challenges, particularly:
- Building sophisticated interactive visualizations for forced alignment
- Ensuring accurate synchronization between audio and text at phoneme/word level
- Creating intuitive interfaces for researchers to correct alignments
- Optimizing performance for complex visualizations and longer recordings
- Testing with real-world data from the School of Psychology

The forced alignment component requires specialized development skills and domain knowledge of linguistics and audio processing, which adds complexity beyond standard web development.
